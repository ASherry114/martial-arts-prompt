# Technique Training Prompt

This application is a tool for Martial Arts students to use when practicing / training techniques.
The benefits from training with the application are;

1. to condition the body and hone techniques through repition,
2. improve the strength and fluidity of transitioning between techniques,
3. training in adapting to and transitioning between techniques that that are not typically sequential in school drills (but may be important in a fight),
4. ???

The program is a (complicated) prompting system utilising audible or visual cues for the user to perform actions.
"Action" is a very vague term that is used quite on purpose here.
The interpretation of the prompt is up to the whims of the user since the audible and visual prompts are very simplistic.
A session could be series of individual tones which represent specific footwork techniques.
Or, a user could also have different tones played through earphones to indicate left and right hand techniques separately.
Alternatively, a user could use the tones to indicate which sequence of techniques they should perform next.

The user will be exposed to technique combinations that are not typical in their classes, and at irregular cadences which are not condusive to group learning.
This will, hopefully, prepare the user for heated fights (competative or otherwise) where their opposition will not be limited to a consitent tempo and will most likely be dishing out anything they have to any gaps in the user's defense.
It is very important for the user to remember that this program will be operating without any regard to the techniques themselves.
So even if the prompt that is generated suggests a kick as you are moving backwards, remember to move backwards first to create the distance before kicking forwards.

Instructions on how to use the program, record techniques, and configure training sessions, can all be found in the [how to guide][howto].
The inner workings and mechanisms of operation of the application are contained in the [developer zone][mechanisms].
